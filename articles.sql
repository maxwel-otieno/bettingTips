(3, 'article', 'BETTING TIPS FOR BEGINNERS', '<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you’re new to sports betting, then you’ve come to the right place to get all of the best tips on how to do it. We’ve built this guide so that you can learn about these pieces of advice to help you advance your gambling skills. Even if you never placed a single sports bet in your life, these tips will help you learn some of the most important things from the get-go.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        On this page, we’re going to showcase our top tips for beginning sports bettors. By reviewing these recommendations, you’ll have a solid idea on how you can jumpstart your sports betting adventures in an informed manner. In turn, that will help you make better betting decisions as you get things started. Many of us on staff here wish that we had read something like this before we got started. Luckily for you, you’re here, and you’ll benefit significantly from the knowledge contained below.\r\n\r\n                        For those of you that are brand new, we’d urge you to read this page in its entirety so that you get the full benefit. However, if you’re pressed for time, and you’d like to see a particular tip, we’ve included links below where you can jump to a specific section. Simply click on the one you’re interested in, and you’ll skip right to that section below.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #1: Start Slowly</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Our number-one tip for beginning sports bettors is to make sure that you start slowly. Understandably, you may be chomping at the bit with excitement to get things started. Trust us; we’ve been there before, too. However, it’s important that you pump the brakes a bit to make sure that you don’t dive in too quickly.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Instead of diving in head-first and making a ton of bets without much knowledge or experience, you’ll want to dip a toe in. By taking a step back, you can increase your chances of winning by learning the basics of sports betting, which is our next tip below.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\'d-flex justify-content-center\'><img src=\'./images/bet_1.png\' alt=\'Image goes here\' style=\'width: 600px; height: 400px;\'><img></div><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #2: Learn the Basics</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">As with many things, it’s essential that you walk before you run. This is especially true with sports betting. For those of you that are new to it, it’s a good idea to take the time to learn the basics before you get too deep into it. By understanding the basics, you’ll make better-informed betting decisions.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Lucky for you, we’ve developed several guides geared towards beginning sports bettors. Below, you’ll find links to our top three that are perfect for you if you’re new. Up first, you’ll have access to our beginner’s guide to sports betting. It’s here that we’ll help you understand the basic building blocks of betting on sports. After that, you should head on over to our getting started page. In this guide, we’ll help you apply the basics that you learned and how to use them to begin betting on sports. Lastly, you can visit the sports betting essentials link below to learn some more advanced strategies once you’ve got a handle on the basics from the first two pieces.<br>\r\n                        While research takes time, it’s well worth it in our opinion. With just a small investment of your time, you’ll be making betting choices with a solid base of knowledge instead of betting as an uninformed beginner.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #3: Have Realistic Expectations</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you’re already planning your exit from your day job because you think that you’re going to make it big with sports betting, you should put a kibosh on that. We hate to break it to you, but the chances are low that you’re going to be able to make a living off of betting on sports. That’s not to say that you can’t make money, but you’ll be hard pressed to make enough that you’ll be able to live off of your betting earnings.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        There are professional sports bettors out there that do make their living off of gambling. However, there’s not a ton of them, and even they still lose quite often. Even the best sports bettors still lose their bets 40%-45% of the time.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        For you, it’s essential to have the right expectations from the start. Betting on sports can be fun, and it can be profitable. However, for you to make money, you’ll need to become a knowledgeable and disciplined sports bettor. You’re off to a good start by checking out this list of top tips, but this is just the beginning. You’ll have to remember to keep your expectations realistic for the life of your sports betting adventures.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #4: Bet with a Clear Mind</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Our next tip for you is to make sure that you’re only betting on sports with real money when you have a clear mind. What we mean by this is that you should never bet when you’re under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Since you’ll be wagering your hard-earned dollars, you only want to do that when your mind is in tip-top shape.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Many folks end up betting on sports when they’ve been drinking. After all, having a drink and watching your favorite sporting events tend to go hand in hand for many individuals. However, we’d suggest that you get your wagers done before you start drinking so that you’re less likely to make poor betting decisions. Since alcohol and drugs impair your decision-making ability, it’s best not to bet on sports when you’re under the influence of anything. If you are under the influence, simply enjoy the sporting event and wait to gamble at a later time when your mind is in a clear state.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #5: Develop a Bankroll Management Plan</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Our next tip is an excellent one to use from day 1 of your sports betting career. Unfortunately, many folks don’t use a plan ever, or if they do, it’s much later than it should have been. The reason that a bankroll management plan is vital is that it helps you calculate exactly how much money you should bet for any given wager.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        This idea might be an odd one if you’re brand new to betting on sports. Many of us on staff here began betting on sports without having one of these plans. Back then, we’d pick a figure from our head and make a bet. In many cases, individuals bet their entire bankroll in one single wager, which isn’t the best idea because if you lose the bet, then your entire bankroll is wiped out in one swoop.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        While bankroll management plans can differ from one another, the general idea is the same for all of them. The goal of the plan is to help you extend your bankroll as long as possible by calculating the percentage of your bankroll used on a wager. Instead of risking it all at once, you’ll only risk a portion of your bankroll on each bet.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #6: Bet on Sports That You Know Well</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">When you’re new to sports betting, it’s always a good idea to stick to betting on sports that you know well. By doing this, you’ll have a higher likelihood of making good betting decisions as opposed to betting on sports that you know little or nothing about. Better choices, in turn, should help you win more of your wagers.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        It can be attractive to want to bet on tons of different sports when you’re brand new. When logging into an online sportsbook, seeing all of the potential betting action can really amp you up to want to place a lot of wagers. However, until you’ve got a good grip of sports betting on the sports that you know well, we’d advise you to hold off on betting on other sports until a later date.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #7: Remain Disciplined</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">One of the hardest struggles when betting on sports is to remain disciplined. When it comes to sports, it’s very easy to allow your emotions to take over. This can be true for new sports bettors, but even experienced ones sometimes have trouble keeping their feelings in check.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        In some instances, you’ll want to bet on your home team even when you shouldn’t. Many of us on staff have been there at one point or another. It’s tough to imagine not betting for your team, even when the numbers clearly state that your team is the underdog. However, it’s vital to keep in mind that the folks coming up with the odds are brilliant individuals who are making their decisions without any emotions attached. You too should do the same.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Conversely, some folks love to bet against their team’s arch-rival. While this can be a good idea when the team is an underdog, it’s not a good idea when the team is a strong favorite. It’s nice to see teams that you don’t care about lose. However, if you’re going to wager real money on it, make sure that it’s a sound bet that makes sense from a statistical standpoint. Otherwise, you’re just throwing away money.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        If you find yourself struggling to keep your emotions in check, then try taking a step back from betting for a bit. By doing this, you’ll remove the possibility of placing wagers that you otherwise would not have made.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #8: Keep Records</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another excellent idea for new sports bettors is to go ahead and establish a method for keeping records of your bets. If you can put this into practice from the outset of your betting career, you’ll be in much better shape than many sports bettors out there.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        By keeping records, you’ll benefit from a couple of different things. First, it will allow you to track your bankroll. Let’s say that you start with $100, and then you have some success and win a few wagers. Without keeping clean records, you might not have an idea that your betting bankroll has increased. If you’ve implemented a bankroll management plan as suggested in tip #5, then keeping records will be vital to the success of your plan.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Along with helping you keep track of your bankroll, using records can also allow you to view your betting record over time. This is excellent, especially if you’ve been trying different betting strategies. Using your recorded data, you can analyze what’s worked in the past for you and what hasn’t. This type of data can then help you improve your betting in the future.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        To keep records, there are two main ways to go about it. The best way is to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel. This is the go-to way that many of us on staff here track our betting records. If Excel isn’t for you, then consider using a notepad to record your data. No matter which one you decide to use, make sure that you remain consistent with it so that your data is always accurate and up to date.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #9: Find a Trusted Betting Site</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">As you begin to look into things, you’ll find that there is no shortage of online betting sites out there ready to accept your wagers. However, it’s crucial that you find a trusted one to work with so that you don’t end up risking your money or your private data on a less than trustworthy site. The good news is that with just a little bit of research, you can locate a trusted place to do all of your sports betting.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Here, we’ve assembled two main pages to help you in your quest to find a trusted online sportsbook. Below, you’ll see a link to our top picks for online betting sites. We’ve combed the internet with the goal of finding only the best of the best in the industry. Each of the sites listed on this page is top-notch and is a secure place for you to do your betting.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        You’ll also see a link below to our page comprised of our blacklisted websites. This page contains all of the sites that we don’t trust in the industry. Each of these online sportsbooks should be avoided so that you can protect yourself and your hard-earned dollars. If you’re planning to do your own research to find your sports betting home, make sure to account for these blacklisted websites.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h2 style=\"color: brown;\">Tip #10: Don’t Pay for Picks</h2>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:18px;\">Our final tip for you is to not pay for any sports betting picks. With life being so busy between work and family, we understand the urge for folks that want to buy picks and tips from others. In an ideal world, it would be nice to do this and save time so that you can tend to the other things pulling at you in life. However, the issue is that many people selling picks and tips are fraudsters or just no good at what they do. Therefore, you may end up wasting cash on worthless recommendations.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        Don’t get us wrong; there are some excellent tipsters and services out there. That being said, they are few and far between. As a beginner, you should focus on learning how to bet yourself instead of relying on others to help you do it for you. As you become more advanced at sports betting, then you might research the possibility of buying picks at a later date. For now, save yourself the cash and avoid the potential of getting ripped off.<br><br></p>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color:#C13333;\">Conclusion</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Hopefully, you now feel like you’re better equipped to begin your sports betting adventures thanks to our list of top picks.

Here’s what you can expect to find in this section.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Contents of This Article</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Top Cryptocurrency Gambling Sites\r\n                        What is Cryptocurrency, Sites Explained, How to Gamble with Cryptocurrency, Making Payments, Cryptocurrency Wallets, How to Mine Cryptocurrency, Beginner’s Guide, Fun Facts\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">The Top Cryptocurrency Gambling Sites Today</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">We should start this section of our site with some of the good stuff – the best places we have found for casino players who wish to use cryptocurrency for payment. These sites that we have listed below all bring the best of software, promotions, and support together, along with strong mobile compatibility. Most importantly, however, is that they also all offer some form of cryptocurrency for deposits and withdrawals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        There are more and more online casino sites that are accepting cryptocurrency these days, but that doesn’t mean that they are all the same quality.

So, let’s break it down here for you in its simplest terms.\r\n\r\n                        Back in 2009, a bunch of very smart folks were trying to come up with a way to pay for goods and services anonymously online (don’t ask why) and came up with the idea of a decentralized, digital currency. This original currency was called Bitcoin and still exists today.<br><br>\r\n\r\n                        The general way that cryptocurrency works is that every transaction between users is written into a digital ledger, and this ledger is copied and stored on a network of multiple computers. This way, if there is a transaction that is only showing up one copy of the ledger, it can be flagged, keeping the ledger form being hacked and altered illegally.\r\n\r\n                        There is a lot more to it, of course, but at its core, cryptocurrency is a decentralized, digital form of payment that is designed to compete with the current traditional forms of payment. For a more detailed understanding of this digital currency format, check out this page.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <div class=\'d-flex justify-content-center\'><img src=\'./images/crypto-gambling.JPG\' alt=\'Image goes here\' style=\'width: 800px; height: 500px;\'><img></div><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Cryptocurrency Gambling Sites</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">There are many widely-accepted cryptocurrencies on the market today, with new coins being introduced at a rapid rate. While the online gambling industry was one of the earliest adopters of these payments, to date, the operators have been focused on adding the most trusted.\r\n\r\n                        We think that if you want to feel comfortable using cryptocurrencies at an online gambling sites (or anywhere for that matter), you need to be up to speed on what these currencies entail, including their history and how they can be used at online gambling sites. That is what these pages below are meant to accomplish.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Bitcoin Gambling Sites</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency, having been built on the original blockchain (the decentralized network) all the way back in 2009. While many other coins now exist, the number of casinos that accept Bitcoin (BTC) is more than any other cryptocurrency, so we take a look at which are the best sites and why you should use Bitcoin for your payments.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Litecoin Gambling Sites</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Another cryptocurrency that was launched all the way back in 2011 on Github, Litecoin is the brainchild of a former Google employee. This is another attempt at creating the same decentralized network with faster speeds. Litecoin (LTC) is an excellent alternative to Bitcoin and is being added as a payment method to more casinos by the day.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Gambling Sites</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">After the original open-source blockchain technology was developed and released, an increasing number of developers looked for ways to improve the original work and reduce some of the issues that came from the popularity of the original. Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that came from a split in the Bitcoin blockchain and is now regarded as the likely successor to the original cryptocurrency.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Ethereum Gambling Sites</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Ethereum is another popular blockchain network, and the currency it created (Ether) is now widely accepted by online gambling sites. Built on the same premise as Bitcoin, but with acceptance speeds that are faster, Ether and the Ethereum blockchain are heralded as more efficient by those who use it. We look at all the sites that accept Ether for payments and what makes one site better than another for players in the long run.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">How to Deposit With Cryptocurrency</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">All this talk about cryptocurrency and its benefits is nice, but understanding how to make a deposit in your online casino account is likely why you came to this page in the first place. Using the currency for online casino deposits and withdrawals is actually not as intimidating as it may look, but you definitely want to know all the right steps to take in order to make the transactions as easy as possible.\r\n\r\n                        We have an entire page dedicated to how to make a deposit with all the currencies we listed above,including the security measures that are taken in the blockchain to prevent your account from being compromised. When you are done reading it, we are certain that you will feel like a seasoned cryptocurrency veteran!</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Cryptocurrency Wallets</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">For as many cryptocurrencies that exist in the marketplace today, there are as many if not more cryptocurrency wallets to choose from. The crypto wallet is exactly as it sounds – a central location for you to manage all your cryptocurrency balances. Some wallets are better than others, and when it comes to online gambling, choosing a wallet that makes it easy to move coins to and from casino sites is a must. There are some crypto wallets that have been around for much longer than others, but that doesn’t mean that the new ones aren’t worth using. You want to be looking for specific attributes of crypto wallets, which we will go into on this page.We look at all the top wallet options for crypto users and show you how to go about setting up a wallet of your own.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">How to Gamble at a Cryptocurrency Gambling Site</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">After having an understanding of how to go about getting some cryptocurrency and how to use it for making a deposit at the gambling site you have chosen, you are all ready to understand how to use the currency for gambling purposes. There are some differences in how each of the sites manages cryptocurrency at the gaming tables and slot machines.\r\n\r\n                        The cryptocurrency that you choose to play with should not have an effect on the games that you are playing, but if you aren’t sure, then you can always check with the casino operator or look in the Terms and Conditions. Operators want to provide you with the best overall gambling experience, and that includes bringing you the best options for playing with cryptocurrency.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size: 20px;\">We have every detail covered for you so that you don’t feel at all uncomfortable when you are ready to enter the casino lobby and choose a game to play.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">How to Mine Cryptocurrency</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Cryptocurrencies are all based on creating coins, and these coins are created by agreeing to manage some of the ledger traffic that manages the coins themselves. People who have the machines set up to store and update ledgers on an ongoing basis are called miners and are rewarded for their actions.\r\n\r\n                        Mining Bitcoin in the early days was something that only a handful of individuals were doing. These days, given the power needed to run these mining computers, there are facilities being built in remote locations that house thousands of computers mining in unison. That doesn’t mean that you can’t get into it now but it is definitely an idea that has matured.\r\n\r\n                        If you are considering becoming a cryptocurrency miner, there are several factors that you should take into consideration before you invest in the hardware that is necessary. We aren’t saying it is a bad idea, but it is more effort than you may think, so reading this guide should prove to be very helpful in the long run.</p><br><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Cryptocurrency Beginner’s Guide<h1>\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color: #C13333;\">Topics in this guide include:</h1>\r\n                        \r\n                        Why people started using cryptocurrency\r\n                        The benefits of using the currency for purchases online, and what the early adopters saw when making the decision.\r\n\r\n                        Understanding cryptocurrency as an investment\r\n                        The investment world is buzzing about getting involved in blockchain technology, but with so many ICOs today, we review what the experts are looking for.\r\n                        Risks of using cryptocurrency\r\n                        Like any investment and payment method for online gaming, there are some risks involved in using cryptocurrency.\r\n\r\n                        Replacing traditional currencies\r\n                        Will crypto replace real-world money?

(5, 'article', 'INTRODUCTION TO ESPORTS BETTING', '<h1 style=\"color:#C13333;\">Guide to Esports Betting Strategy</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you are somewhat serious about your career as an esports bettor, then you must’ve already researched various esports betting strategies. After all, a proper esports betting strategy is what can make or break a bettor! Well, if all previous strategies managed to fail you, and you’re still looking for that miraculous one, perhaps we can be of service.\r\n\r\n                        In the next couple of sections, we’ll do our best to explain the new age of online esports betting as well as the best methods to be successful as an esports bettor. There are many things to cover, so we won’t waste your time.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Let’s start off with the basics, shall we?</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color:#C13333;\">What is Esports Betting?</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Esports betting is a relatively new form of online betting that allows the user to make real money wagers on various esports titles. Various esports titles can range from virtually all games bearing a solid dose of esports presence. Game genres are irrelevant as far as esports betting is concerned – MOBA, FPS, RTS, racing, and sports simulations are all put in the same basket when talking about esports betting.\r\n\r\n                        Betting on esports is a pretty common sight to see nowadays. But, a couple of years ago this wasn’t the case at all. Barely anyone knew about esports, let alone esports betting strategy – but we’re talking about a booming industry here, so it’s no wonder trends change.\r\n\r\n                        However, when compared to betting on traditional sports, esports betting doesn’t exactly fit the recipe. Let’s check the matter up close and see what’s it all about!</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color:#C13333;\">Differences Between Esports and Sports Betting</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Believe it or not, there’s a big difference between betting on regular sports and esports. Even though it might not seem so at first, long-term betting results will suffer if you use sports betting strategies with esports. Let us elaborate on that:</p><br>\r\n                        <h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">A More Dynamic Environment</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">The esports industry has been making a name for itself in one simple way – through the internet. And we all know the internet is a much more dynamic media channel than what regular sports are using (that would mainly be television). With a dynamic online media channel comes a dynamic environment prone to drastic changes in the industry. However, esports can be considered as a more dynamic environment due to Meta changes too.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Meta Changes Affect the Outcomes</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">For those of you who don’t know, Meta is the optimal way to play a certain game/sport. It’s the optimal method to secure a win over the opposing team that’s been recognized by the industry’s experts. There are certain things that can drastically change Meta in the most popular esports titles. Changes in weapon penetration or cost in CS:GO, or nerfing items or hero skills in League of Legends and Dota 2 are the perfect examples of Meta changers.<br>\r\n\r\n                        While similar things do occur in other sports too (rule changes, formation/play frequency), they are much rarer than in esports. Due to frequent Meta changes, esports bettors need to keep up the pace in order to stay on top of it. Luckily for them, esports information is a lot easier to access than regular sports information.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Information Is More Accessible</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Yes, we are aware there is plenty of regular sports information available online, but hold on for a second. Here is what we’re referring to – social media posts written by professional athletes. The best way to obtain valuable esports betting strategy information is definitely following the world’s greatest esports athletes. Football, basketball, and NFL players are very active too, but they aren’t sharing as much personal info as frequently as the best esports players. We’re sure this will change in the near future, so make sure you get the best of it while you still can!</p>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div class=\'d-flex justify-content-center mt-5 mb-5\'><img src=\'./images/Esports-Betting.JPG\' alt=\'Image goes here\' style=\'width: 800px; height: 600px;\'><img></div><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color:#C13333;\">Most Common Esports Betting Methods | Staking Examples</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now, let’s switch our topic to some of the most common betting methods out there. Even though they’re technically universal, their esports adaptation works like a charm.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"font-weight: bold\">Double Chance</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Most of the time people tend to bet on the simplest bets – 1×2. 2-way (in matches without draws) and 3-way (in matches with draws) bets are still the most popular ones even though there’s no lack in special bets nowadays. Double chance betting works only with 3-way matches. You might think this automatically eliminates CS:GO matches since they can’t end in draws, but that’s not always true. Some bookies see 15-15 as the final result even though there’s overtime to be played afterward.\r\n\r\n                        If you want to increase your chances of winning 3-way bets, double chance betting might be the way to go. Instead of going for either 1, X, or 2, double chance bets allow you to bet on two out of three possible outcomes. In other words, you can bet on 1X (team 1 wins or draw), X2 (team 2 wins or draw), or 12 (either team wins). Double chance betting odds are much smaller though, but some people love them for minimizing the risk.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"font-weight: bold\">Modified Martingale</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">This system draws roots back to roulette and other casino games with 50/50 odds but is often used in a esports betting strategy as well. That’s why we are calling it the Modified Martingale. Disregarding the odds since we are talking about esports here – the classic Martingale betting strategy relies on doubling up your bets after each consecutive loss. If your initial bet was $10 and you lose six times in a row, your next bet would be $1,280. Not good at all, eh?\r\n\r\n                        Modified Martingale, on the other hand, lowers the third bet amount so instead of going 10, 20, 40, 80; you’ll be going 10, 20, 30, 60. This method gives out better odds for smaller bankrolls and can be effectively used with esports bets too. Just make sure your odds are equal to or higher than two; otherwise, you’re doomed to fail.</p>\r\n\r\n                        <h3 style=\"font-weight: bold\">Fibonacci Formula</h3>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">The Fibonacci sequence is an ever-present feature in our world. Many people call it nature’s code because its numbers are present all around us. But what good is this chain of numbers when it comes to betting? Well, just like all other progressive betting systems, Fibonacci Formula most likely won’t help you beat bookies. But, what it can do is give you a less risky environment for winning some extra money.\r\n\r\n                        For those of you who aren’t familiar with the Fibonacci sequence, it basically relies on the next number being the sum of the previous two. In other words, here’s what the first few numbers of Fibonacci sequence look like: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on. By following this path on each consecutive loss, you will get a much more forgiving betting curve.</p><br>\r\n\r\n                        <h1 style=\"color:#C13333;\">Esports Betting Strategy | Checklist</h1>\r\n                        <p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Now that you know more about the most popular esports betting systems, it’s time to sum things up into a small checklist.
